# Domain: Automobile

## Context: 
The data concerns city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon, to be predicted in terms of 3 multivalued discrete and 5 continuous attributes

## Data Description:
The data concerns city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon

## Attribute Information:

1. mpg: continuous
2. cylinders: multi-valued discrete
3. displacement: continuous
4. horsepower: continuous
5. weight: continuous
6. acceleration: continuous
7. model year: multi-valued discrete
8. origin: multi-valued discrete
9. car name: string (unique for each instance)


## PROJECT OBJECTIVE:
Goal is to cluster the data and treat them as individual datasets to train Regression models to predict ‘mpg’
